Experiment w/ Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms
===
Due to both the power and simplicity of virtual neural networks, they are a perfect candidate for creation through genetic algorithms.  While this approach can achieve great importance in the field of artificial intelligence, it is a lot more fun to use it to create virtual creatures, such as the work of Karl Sims, 1994.

This project is an hybrid approach between various techniques to create such virtual creatures for media applications such as film CGI and video games.
